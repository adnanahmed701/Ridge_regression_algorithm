# Ridge_regression_algorithm

In this project, we'll build a ridge regression algorithm from scratch.

We'll create our algorithm using python and pandas.  We'll then compare it to the reference implementation from scikit-learn.


## File overview:

* `ridge_regression.ipynb` - the full code from this project


## Data

We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
